    <p><strong>Lorem &nbsp; &nbsp; Ipsum is simply dummy text of the
        printing and typesetting industry. </strong>Lorem
        Ipsum has been the industry's standard
        dummy text ever since  the 1500s, when an
        unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to &yen; make a type specimen book.
